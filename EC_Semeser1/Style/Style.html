            <h1>Antiquated or outdated infrastructure can lead to unreliable and untrustworthy systems. Management
                    must recognize that when technology becomes outdated, there is a risk of losing data
                    integrity from attacks. Managementâ€™s strategic planning should always include an analysis of
                    the technology currently in use. Ideally, proper planning by management should prevent technology
                    from becoming obsolete, but when obsolescence is clear, management must take immediate
                    action. IT professionals play a large role in the identification of probable obsolescence</h1>
