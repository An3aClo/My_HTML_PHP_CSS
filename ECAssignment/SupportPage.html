		<p>Doctors such as a paediatricians and family doctors both play a role by often being the first to consider such a diagnosis. Since a paediatrician is seeing a child more frequently than a specialist is. A paediatrician well-versed in autism can help the family identify struggles with daily routine, toileting, transitioning, sleep, eating sensitivities and gastrointestinal issues. The child's doctor can then help the family access the best resources in the area and also discuss funding issues. Some paediatricians will also feel comfortable with medication management for significant behaviour or inattention issues.
