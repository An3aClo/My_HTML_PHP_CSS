			<hr noshade align=“ left” width="70%" color=“000000” size="1">
			<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autism are both general terms for a group of complex disorders of brain development. These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. With the May 2013 publication of the DSM-5 diagnostic manual, all autism disorders were merged into one umbrella diagnosis of ASD. Previously, they were recognized as distinct subtypes, including autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger syndrome.
				<br>
				<br> ASD can be associated with intellectual disability, difficulties in motor coordination and attention and physical health issues such as sleep and gastrointestinal disturbances. Some persons with ASD excel in visual skills, music, math and art.
				<br>
				<br> Autism appears to have its roots in very early brain development. However, the most obvious signs of autism and symptoms of autism tend to emerge between 2 and 3 years of age. Autism Speaks continues to fund research on effective methods for earlier diagnosis, as early intervention with proven behavioral therapies can improve outcomes. Increasing autism awareness is a key aspect of this work and one in which our families and volunteers play an invaluable role. </p>

			<p class="WhyImportantHeader">What causes Autism </p>
			<hr noshade align=“ left” width="70%" color=“000000” size="1">
			<p>Not long ago, the answer to this question would have been “we have no idea.” Research is now delivering the answers. First and foremost, we now know that there is no one cause of autism just as there is no one type of autism. Over the last five years, scientists have identified a number of rare gene changes, or mutations, associated with autism. A small number of these are sufficient to cause autism by themselves. Most cases of autism, however, appear to be caused by a combination of autism risk genes and environmental factors influencing early brain development.
				<br>
				<br> In the presence of a genetic predisposition to autism, a number of nongenetic, or “environmental,” stresses appear to further increase a child’s risk. The clearest evidence of these autism risk factors involves events before and during birth. They include advanced parental age at time of conception (both mom and dad), maternal illness during pregnancy and certain difficulties during birth, particularly those involving periods of oxygen deprivation to the baby’s brain. It is important to keep in mind that these factors, by themselves, do not cause autism. Rather, in combination with genetic risk factors, they appear to modestly increase risk.
				<br>
				<br> A growing body of research suggests that a woman can reduce her risk of having a child with autism by taking prenatal vitamins containing folic acid and/or eating a diet rich in folic acid (at least 600 mcg a day) during the months before and after conception.
				<br>
				<br> Increasingly, researchers are looking at the role of the immune system in autism. Autism Speaks is working to increase awareness and investigation of these and other issues, where further research has the potential to improve the lives of those who struggle with autism. </p>

			<hr noshade align=“ left” width="70%" color=“000000” size="1">
			<p>Until recently, experts talked about different types of autism, such as autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). But now they are all called “autism spectrum disorders.”</p>

				<p>If you still hear people use some of the older terms, you’ll want to know what they mean:</p>
			</center>
			<div class="contactGat">
				<p><b><u>Asperger's syndrome</u></b></p>
			</div>
			<p>This is on the milder end of the autism spectrum. A person with Asperger's may be very intelligent and able to handle her daily life. She may be really focused on topics that interest her and discuss them nonstop. But she has a much harder time socially.</p>
			<div class="contactGat">
				<h4><b><u>PDD-NOS</u></b></h4> </div>
			<p>Pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). This mouthful of a diagnosis included most children whose autism was more severe than Asperger's syndrome, but not as severe as autistic disorder.</p>
			<div class="contactGat">
				<p><b><u>Autistic disorder</u></b></p>
			</div>
			<p>This older term is further along the autism spectrum than Asperger’s and PDD-NOS. It includes the same types of symptoms, but at a more intense level.</p>
			<div class="contactGat">
				<p><b><u>Childhood disintegrative disorder</u></b></p>
			</div>
			<p>This was the rarest and most severe part of the spectrum. It described children who develop normally and then quickly lose many social, language, and mental skills, usually between ages 2 and 4. Often, these children also developed a seizure disorder.</p>

			<p class="WhyImportantHeader">Symptoms of Aspergers disorder </p>
			<hr noshade align=“ left” width="70%" color=“000000” size="1">
			<p>Although there are many possible symptoms of Asperger's syndrome, the main symptom is significant trouble with social situations. Your child may have mild to severe symptoms or have a few or many of these symptoms. Because of the wide variety of symptoms, no two children with Asperger's are alike.</p>
			<center><img src="images/three.png"></center>
			<div class="contactGat">
				<p><b><u>Symptoms during childhood</u></b></p>
			</div>
			<p>Parents often first notice the symptoms of Asperger's syndrome when their child starts preschool and begins to interact with other children. Children with Asperger's syndrome may:</p>
			<div class="myList">
				<ul>
					<li>Not pick up on social cues and may lack inborn social skills, such as being able to read others' body language, start or maintain a conversation, and take turns talking.</li>
					<li>Dislike any changes in routines.</li>
					<li>Appear to lack empathy.</li>
					<li>Be unable to recognize subtle differences in speech tone, pitch, and accent that alter the meaning of others' speech. So your child may not understand a joke or may take a sarcastic comment literally. And his or her speech may be flat and hard to understand because it lacks tone, pitch, and accent.</li>
					<li>Have a formal style of speaking that is advanced for his or her age. For example, the child may use the word "beckon" instead of "call" or the word "return" instead of "come back."</li>
					<li>Talk a lot, usually about a favorite subject. One-sided conversations are common. Internal thoughts are often verbalized.</li>
					<li>Avoid eye contact or stare at others.</li>
					<li>Have unusual facial expressions or postures.</li>
					<li>Be preoccupied with only one or few interests, which he or she may be very knowledgeable about. Many children with Asperger's syndrome are overly interested in parts of a whole or in unusual activities, such as designing houses, drawing highly detailed scenes, or studying astronomy. They may show an unusual interest in certain topics such as snakes, names of stars, or dinosaurs.</li>
					<li>Have delayed motor development. Your child may be late in learning to use a fork or spoon, ride a bike, or catch a ball. He or she may have an awkward walk. Handwriting is often poor.</li>
					<li>Have heightened sensitivity and become overstimulated by loud noises, lights, or strong tastes or textures. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="contactGat">
				<p><b><u>Symptoms during adolescent and teen years</u></b></p>
			</div>
			<p>Most symptoms persist through the teen years. And although teens with Asperger's can begin to learn those social skills they lack, communication often remains difficult. They will probably continue to have difficulty "reading" others' behavior.
				<br>
				<br> Your teen with Asperger's syndrome (like other teens) will want friends but may feel shy or intimidated when approaching other teens. He or she may feel "different" from others. Although most teens place emphasis on being and looking "cool," teens with Asperger's may find it frustrating and emotionally draining to try to fit in. They may be immature for their age and be naive and too trusting, which can lead to teasing and bullying.
				<center><img src="images/two.PNG"></center>
				<br>
				<br> All of these difficulties can cause teens with Asperger's to become withdrawn and socially isolated and to have depression or anxiety.
				<br>
				<br> But some teens with Asperger's syndrome are able to make and keep a few close friends through the school years. Some of the classic Asperger's traits may also work to the benefit of your teen. Teens with Asperger's are typically uninterested in following social norms, fads, or conventional thinking, allowing creative thinking and the pursuit of original interests and goals. Their preference for rules and honesty may lead them to excel in the classroom and as citizens.</p>
			<div class="contactGat">
				<p><b><u>Symptoms in adulthood</u></b></p>
			</div>
			<p>Asperger's syndrome is a lifelong condition, although it tends to stabilize over time, and improvements are often seen. Adults usually have a better understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses. They are able to learn social skills, including how to read others' social cues. Many people with Asperger's syndrome marry and have children.
				<center><img src="images/adult.PNG"></center>
				<br> Some traits that are typical of Asperger's syndrome, such as attention to detail and focused interests, can increase chances of university and career success. Many people with Asperger's seem to be fascinated with technology, and a common career choice is engineering. But scientific careers are by no means the only areas where people with Asperger's excel. Indeed, many respected historical figures have had symptoms of Asperger's, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and Thomas Jefferson.</p>

			<p class="WhyImportantHeader">How to diagnose Aspergers disorder </p>
			<hr noshade align=“ left” width="70%" color=“000000” size="1">
			<p>Autism spectrum conditions have only become more widely recognised in recent years. Now though, with the focus on assessment and diagnosis in young children, it is often when a child is diagnosed that the parents start to recognise certain behaviours in themselves or one another.
				<br>
				<br> The interim period while waiting for an appointment for assessment and diagnosis can be very stressful. Counselling with a specialist counsellor during this time can be helpful for both partners but particularly for the NT partner.
				<br>
				<br> Getting a diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome as an adult can be difficult, especially as the condition isn’t always easily recognised. There are two routes to diagnosis: the NHS route and the private route.</p>
			<div class="contactGat">
				<p><b><u>Diagnosis by the NHS</u></b></p>
			</div>
			<p> The first point of contact should be your local GP who you can ask to refer you and/or your partner to the local mental health team. For many, this team will be in their local town or city and provide an assessment and diagnosis. Sadly, the waiting times in most areas are lengthy, varying from a few months to two years or more.</p>
			<div class="contactGat">
				<center><img src="images/seven.PNG" height="300" width="600"></center>
				<p><b><u>The private route to diagnosis</u></b></p>
			</div>
			<p> The private route often involves the person referring themselves to the diagnostic service. The cost of an assessment range from approximately £200 to over £1,000. The National Autistic Society has details of professionals all over the UK who have autism expertise.</p>
