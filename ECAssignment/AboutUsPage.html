		<p>In the world we live in, our days might be so full and busy that we might not even notice that we are surrounded by people who experience meltdowns because of their senses were assaulted. People who scream because their anxiety got the best of them. People who break out in aggression and tears because communication does not work. All of this is the day to day lives of a lot people who lives with Autism.</p>
		<p> Wouldn’t it be nice if we all could understand what these people go through? Wouldn’t it be nice for people who live with this terrifying autism spectrum disorder to know that we get it? </p>
		<p>If the people living with this disorder knew we get it, they would be able to work through it all and wouldn’t feel embarrassed or on edge when an outbreak episode happens. They would be able to laugh with us enjoy the small moments in life that go past so quickly. They would be able to make memories of all these moments shared with people who understand, people that will become their friends. For this reason, awareness of this soul death bearing Autism disorders is essential.</p>
